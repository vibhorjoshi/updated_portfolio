## ü§ñ Gemini API Integration

The Google Gemini API is at the heart of the portfolio's interactive features.

### 1. AI Assistant Chatbot

- **Context-Aware Responses**: The chatbot is initialized with a `systemInstruction` that provides it with the full context of my portfolio (skills, projects, experience). This allows it to answer user questions accurately and intelligently without hallucinating information.
- **Real-time Conversation**: It uses the `ai.chats.create()` method to maintain a conversational flow, allowing for follow-up questions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The chat window includes a typing indicator for a better user experience and is designed to be intuitive and engaging.

### 2. Dynamic Greeting

- **Personalized Welcome**: On page load, the app calls `ai.models.generateContentStream()` with a simple prompt to generate a friendly, one-sentence greeting.
- **Streaming for Performance**: The greeting is streamed token-by-token, allowing the text to appear gradually for a smooth effect.
- **Robust Fallback**: In case of an API error, a graceful fallback message is displayed to ensure the UI never feels broken.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into two main files for simplicity:

- **`index.html`**: Contains the complete HTML structure, all CSS styling (within `<style>` tags), and the core JavaScript logic for animations (Three.js, GSAP, particles) and project rendering. It also includes the `<script type="importmap">` to handle modern JS modules directly in the browser.
- **`index.tsx`**: Contains all the React code for the AI-powered components (`App`, `Chatbot`). This file is compiled by the browser's native module support and rendered into the `<div id="root">` element in `index.html`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Get your API Key:**
    - Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get your own Gemini API key.

3.  **Add the API Key:**
    - Open the `index.tsx` file.
    - Find the lines where `GoogleGenAI` is initialized: `const ai = new GoogleGenAI({apiKey: process.env.API_KEY});`
    - Replace `process.env.API_KEY` with your actual API key as a string. For example:
      ```javascript
      // Before
      const ai = new GoogleGenAI({apiKey: process.env.API_KEY});
      
      // After
      const ai = new GoogleGenAI({apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'});
      ```

4.  **Run a local server:**
    - Because this project uses ES modules, you need to serve the files from a local server. You cannot just open `index.html` directly from your file system.
    - The easiest way is to use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code. Simply right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    - Alternatively, you can use a simple command-line server:
      ```bash
      # If you have Python 3 installed
      python -m http.server
      
      # Or if you have Node.js installed
      npx serve
      ```
    - Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## üé® Customization

Feel free to fork this repository and customize it for your own portfolio!

- **Update Your Information**:
  - To update the chatbot's knowledge, modify the `portfolioContext` string in `index.tsx`.
  - To change the projects, edit the `projects` array in the main script of `index.html`.
  - Update the text in the HTML sections (`#about`, `#experience`, etc.) with your own details.
- **Change the Theme**: All color variables are at the top of the `<style>` section in `index.html`. You can easily change the pink/purple "Pink Nebula" theme to match your personal brand.
